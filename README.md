To create an e-commerce website that has both customer-facing and admin sections. Both sections should be responsive and the website will be populated by a Strapi API supplied by Noroff.


## Description

This website is designed with Adobe XD and has a homepage, product list, product details, and cart pages as frontend requirements. The admin side has pages for creating, updating, and deleting products. Building a checkout and payment system is not a part of the project.
The admin credentials are:

- email: admin@admin.com
- username: admin
- password: Pass1234
